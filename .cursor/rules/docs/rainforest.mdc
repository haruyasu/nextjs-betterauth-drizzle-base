include_html



optional



Determines whether raw HTML is included in the response (this can increase the size of the response). Can be set to true or false (the default).  


Note When adding requests with include_html=true to a Collection the maximum number of requests is lower (100) because including the HTML within the response makes the Collection Result Sets much larger. The limit is in place to ensure Result Set files are of a manageable size. If you have need to run a large number of requests all with include_html=true then simply split the requests across multiple 100-request Collections.



output



optional



Determines the format in which results are returned. Can be set to json (default) to get the results as structured JSON, html to get the raw html retrieved or csv to return the results in CSV format. When using csv you can also use the csv_fields parameter to specify which fields to return in the CSV.



csv_fields



optional



Determines the fields that are returned when returning in csv mode (i.e. when the output parameter is set to csv ). Should be specified as a comma seperated list of fields (in nested field, dot notation, format). For more information on the csv_fields parameter please see the CSV Fields Reference .



customer_location



optional



Determines the location that Rainforest uses when retrieving pages from Amazon. This is useful, for example, for seeing details of how a product appears on amazon.com, to a customer located in a different country. Can be used to identify cross-border shipping data and opportunities. For more available values of customer_location please see the Customer Locations Reference . If no value for customer_location is supplied then Rainforest defaults to making the request from the country of the Amazon page requested - i.e. "France" for requests for pages from "amazon.fr".



customer_zipcode



optional



Determines the specific customer zipcode or postal code location of the request. This is useful, for example, for seeing details highly localized listings such as Amazon Fresh.  


To use the customer_zipcode parameter you must first setup the zipcode, for the given Amazon Domain, in the zipcodes section of the Dashboard.  


For more information please see the Customer Zipcode Reference .  


Note The customer_zipcode parameter cannot be used in conjuction with the customer_location parameter.



language



optional



Determines the display language Rainforest requests the Amazon page in. For languages Amazon support see Supported Languages .



currency



optional



Determines the currency Rainforest requests the Amazon page. For supported currency values for each Amazon domain see the Supported Currencies .



skip_on_incident



optional



Instructs the API to not serve requests when a parsing incident is detected. Valid values are all (where the API will not serve a response if a "degraded" or "major" parsing incident is live) and major_only (where the API will not serve a response is a "major" parsing incident is live, but will if a "degraded service" parsing incident is live).  


You can view service status via the status page .  


Using skip_on_incident can be desirable if your system is making unsupervised requests to the API that you would like to gracefully fail in the event of an incident.



associate_id



optional



Pass your Amazon Associate ID (your Amazon affiliate ID) and Rainforest will append your Associate ID to all Amazon links returned in all API responses (by appending the tag=YOURASSOCIATEID parameter to all returned Amazon links).



include_fields



optional



A comma-seperated list JSON field names to include in the JSON object the API returns. You can specify the field names in dot notation - i.e. include_fields=pagination will only include the the pagination property in the response JSON. Use include_fields if you only want to include specific fields in the API's JSON response.



exclude_fields



optional



A comma-seperated list of JSON field names to exclude from the JSON object the API returns. You can specify the field names in dot notation - i.e. exclude_fields=pagination will remove the pagination property from the response JSON. Use exclude_fields if there are specific fields you wish to exclude from the API's JSON response.
